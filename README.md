# Vuex4Flutter

## Before getting starting

It's strong recommended to already have some experience using Vuex

> Vuex is a **state management pattern + library** for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion

## Getting starting

Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="pubspec.yaml" %}
```yaml
dependencies:
  vuex4flutter: ^0.0.1
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
 Please, be sure installing the latest stable version
{% endhint %}

You can install packages from the command line:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```
